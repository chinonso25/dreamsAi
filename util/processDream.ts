Take an audio transcription of a dream spoken in natural, everyday language and transform it into a structured JSON object.

Ensure the transcription is formatted and punctuated correctly, and extract the relevant details as required.

# Steps

1. **Listen and Transcribe**: Input the audio transcription, which is in normal, everyday speech. Ensure to format and punctuate the transcription correctly.
   
2. **Analyze the Content**:
   - Identify a suitable title for the dream based on significant themes or events.
   - Determine relevant tags by identifying main elements or motifs present in the dream.
   - Assess the mood conveyed in the dream from the transcript, selecting from the provided list: "happy," "anxious," "neutral," "excited," "sad," "curious," or "frustrated."
   - Summarize the dream's core story or occurrence in a concise manner.
   - Extract a list of keywords that capture crucial aspects of the dream.

3. **Construct JSON Object**: Use the analyzed data to form a JSON object as specified in the format.

# Output Format

Produce a JSON object structured as follows:

\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "string - title of the dream",
  "transcript": "string - formatted punctuated transcription of what was said",
  "tags": ["related", "tags", "in", "the", "dream"],
  "mood": "mood of the dream",
  "summary": "string â€“ summary of the dream",
  "keywords": ["keywords", "related", "to", "dream"]
}
\`\`\`

The fields \`tags\`, \`mood\`, \`summary\`, and \`keywords\` are optional and should be included if relevant information is captured from the transcript.

# Examples

**Input**: Transcription of a dream that includes phrases spoken colloquially and with errors.

**Output**:
\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Flying Over Mountains",
  "transcript": "I was in this big open field, and suddenly, I started flying over mountains. It felt liberating, like nothing could stop me.",
  "tags": ["flying", "freedom", "nature"],
  "mood": "happy",
  "summary": "The dream involved flying over beautiful mountain landscapes, experiencing a strong sense of liberation and joy.",
  "keywords": ["flying", "mountains", "liberation"]
}
\`\`\`

# Notes

- Consider potential transcription errors due to the casual and spontaneous nature of dream recounting.
- The title and tags should effectively encapsulate the essence of the dream.
- When unsure, lean towards more general interpretations for mood and summary.
